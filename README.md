# Minesweeper

This is a simple Minesweeper game written in JavaScript. The game is played on a grid of squares, some of which contain mines. The player's goal is to reveal all of the squares without clicking on a mine.

## How to play

To play the game, click on a square to reveal it. If the square contains a number, that number indicates how many mines are adjacent to the square. If the square contains a mine, the game is over.

To mark a square as a mine, right-click on the square. Marked squares will be highlighted in yellow.
